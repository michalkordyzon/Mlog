## Introduction
OCR on documents remains a challenging task. While printed text can often be recognized with 95% or higher accuracy, real-world documents — containing handwriting, non-standard layouts, and other irregularities — are still much harder to read accurately. There are high quality systems solving documents reading in sub-tasks: OCR, layout analysis, structure recognition, classification.  
Recent trend is using large language models to solve whole convertion task in one shot, and giving the user opportunity to define additional specific tasks to do in the prompt.ś



This post is a summary of the SmolDocling [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11576) along with some personal experiences from working with it.


## Architecture
SmolDocling model comes from family of Hugging Face's SmolVLM. It was trained on datasets allowing for recognition of captions, charts, forms, code, equations, tables, footnotes, lists, page footers & headers, section headings, and text. SmolDocling does OCR on elements mentioned and recognizes the type and location. And here we have main task of SmolDocling - conversion and docuemnt understatning.
