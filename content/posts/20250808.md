## Introduction
OCR on documents remains a challenging task. While printed text can often be recognized with 95% accuracy or higher, real-world documents — containing handwriting, non-standard layouts, and other irregularities — are still much harder to read accurately.

This post is a summary of the SmolDocling [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11576) along with some personal experiences from working with it.


## Architecture
SmolDocling model comes from family of Hugging Face's SmolVLM. It was trained on datasets allowing for recognition of captions, charts, forms, code, equations, tables, footnotes, lists, page footers & headers, section headings, and text. SmolDocling does OCR on those elements and recognizes the type and location. And here we have main task of SmolDocling - conversion and docuemnt understatning.
