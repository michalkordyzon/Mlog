<!-- ## Datasets

Several interesting datasets were used for Granite Vision training. First is DocFM, a dataset created in IBM and mentioned in previous note on smalDocling model. Granite Vision Team focused on using only  a part of DocFM, specifically on synthetic visual QA datasets as a seed for creation synthetic dataset named DocFM verbalization-based VQA (DocFM VQA). Verbalized representation is simply descrption of visual elemnts like charts or pictures, etc. 
Similarly, next sythetic datasets were created: 
- Synthetic Chart VQA, synthetic chart with QA pairs
- Synthetic Flowchart VQA, synthetic flowcharts with QA pairs
- DocFM-ChartExtraction, synthetic dataset for teaching the Granive Vision how to extract data from tables
- DocFM Visual Cue and Captioning, 
- DocFM Rule Based Grounding  

Full corpus of datasets used for Granite Vision training is in the picture below.

## Data preprocessing

Data pre-processing consisted of several annotation and filtering procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with regulatory and safety standards as well as improving data quality.
Restricted Data removal: All public datasets were subject to a legal review to detect any potential licensing or PII-related risks. Data with unclear usage rights or originating outside the US was excluded.
CSAM removal: State-of-the-art NSFW detection systems were applied to eliminate all Child Sexual Abuse Material.
Face blurring: All visual PII was obfuscated by applying automated face-blurring techniques.
Deduplication: To avoid redundancy across merged collections, duplicate records were removed. Detection relied on exact pixel matching and perceptual hash methods to account for minor variations, as well as identification of duplicate text entries. -->
