&lt;p>OCR on documents remains a challenging task. While printed text can often be recognized with 95% accuracy or higher, real-world documents — containing handwriting, non-standard layouts, and other irregularities — are still much harder to read accurately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is a summary of the SmolDocling &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11576">research paper&lt;/a> along with some personal experiences from working with it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>SmolDocling model comes from family of Hugging Face&amp;rsquo;s SmolVLM. It was trained on datasets allowing for recognition of captions, charts, forms, code, equations, tables, footnotes, lists, page footers &amp;amp; headers, section headings, and text. SmolDocling does OCR on those elements and recognizes the type and location. And here we have main task of SmolDocling - conversion and docuemnt understatning.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
